## 🚀 What is SmartRoute?

**SmartRoute** is an interactive web application for visualizing and understanding graph algorithms like:

- 📌 **Dijkstra's Algorithm**  
- 🔄 **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- ✨ **A\* Pathfinding**  

Built for **learners, educators, and curious minds** who want to explore how shortest path algorithms really work—step by step.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎨 **Interactive Graph Editor** – Add, drag, and link nodes visually.
- 🔁 **Directed & Undirected Graphs** – Easily toggle graph types.
- 🧠 **Multiple Algorithms** – Choose from Dijkstra, BFS, and A*.
- 🎬 **Step-by-Step Animations** – Watch the algorithm unfold in real time or at your own pace.
- 📏 **Path & Distance Display** – Clearly shows results of the shortest path.
- 💬 **Instant Node Feedback** – Get quick messages when selecting source/destination nodes.
- 📱 **Responsive UI** – Built with React + Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern interface.

## 📚 Algorithms Explained

<details>
<summary><strong>🔹 Dijkstra’s Algorithm</strong></summary>

- **Purpose:** Finds shortest paths from a single source node to all others in a weighted graph (no negative weights).
- **How:** Uses a priority queue to always explore the lowest-distance node next.
- **Use Case:** GPS, traffic routing, network latency.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔸 Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong></summary>

- **Purpose:** Shortest path in an unweighted graph (or equal-weight edges).
- **How:** Explores layer by layer using a queue.
- **Use Case:** Social networks, games, tree traversals.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⭐ A* (A Star)</strong></summary>

- **Purpose:** Shortest path using heuristic guidance (e.g., Euclidean distance).
- **How:** Expands nodes based on estimated total cost to goal.
- **Use Case:** AI pathfinding, robotics, games.
</details>

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Add Nodes:** Click on the canvas to add nodes.
2. **Connect Nodes:** Click and drag from one node to another to create edges. Double-click edge weights to edit them.
3. **Select Source/Destination:** Double-click a node to set it as the source, then double-click another node to set as destination. Temporary messages will confirm your selection.
4. **Choose Graph Type:** Use the dropdown to switch between directed and undirected graphs.
5. **Select Algorithm:** Use the dropdown to choose Dijkstra, BFS, or A*.
6. **Start Animation:** Click "Start" to visualize the algorithm. Use the play/pause/reset controls as needed.
7. **Step Mode:** Enable "Steps" to manually advance the algorithm using the "Next Step" button.
8. **View Results:** The shortest path and its total distance will be displayed in the left panel.
