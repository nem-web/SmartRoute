# SmartRoute

SmartRoute is a visual and interactive web application for exploring and understanding graph algorithms such as **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Users can create custom graphs, select source and destination nodes, and visualize the shortest path and traversal process step-by-step.

## üìö Algorithms Explained

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

- **Purpose:** Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph (no negative weights).
- **How it works:**
  - Uses a priority queue to always expand the node with the smallest known distance.
  - Updates distances to neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.
  - Stops when the destination node is reached (for single-pair shortest path).
- **Use case:** Navigation, network routing, etc.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- **Purpose:** Finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph (or when all weights are equal).
- **How it works:**
  - Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level.
  - Uses a queue to keep track of the next nodes to visit.
  - The first time the destination is reached, the path is guaranteed to be the shortest.
- **Use case:** Social networks, unweighted routing, puzzle solving.

### A\* Algorithm

- **Purpose:** Finds the shortest path using heuristics to guide the search (typically faster than Dijkstra for many cases).
- **How it works:**
  - Uses a priority queue and a heuristic function (e.g., Euclidean distance) to estimate the cost to the goal.
  - Expands nodes that appear to be closer to the destination.
- **Use case:** Pathfinding in games, robotics, navigation.

## üñ±Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Add Nodes:** Click on the canvas to add nodes.
2. **Connect Nodes:** Click and drag from one node to another to create edges. Double-click edge weights to edit them.
3. **Select Source/Destination:** Double-click a node to set it as the source, then double-click another node to set as destination. Temporary messages will confirm your selection.
4. **Choose Graph Type:** Use the dropdown to switch between directed and undirected graphs.
5. **Select Algorithm:** Use the dropdown to choose Dijkstra, BFS, or A\*.
6. **Start Animation:** Click "Start" to visualize the algorithm. Use the play/pause/reset controls as needed.
7. **Step Mode:** Enable "Steps" to manually advance the algorithm using the "Next Step" button.
8. **View Results:** The shortest path and its total distance will be displayed in the left panel.
